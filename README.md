- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tawes1994, also known as Roland. My dream is to work in development. I have a strong passion for creating clean and efficient solutions. For me, problems don’t really exist—we just haven’t found the right solution yet.
- 👀 I’m currently interested in software development with Python and C#. I also believe that knowing HTML and CSS is quite useful. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, HTML, CSS, and Python.
- 📫 The best way is via Discord (Tawes).
- 🙌 I’m always happy to collaborate on interesting projects or to receive feedback on my work! 
- 🌐 I’m passionate about learning full-stack development because it allows me to understand the bigger picture of how web applications work.
     While I enjoy both frontend and backend development, I’m open to focusing on one area in the future.
     For now, learning both helps me appreciate the connections between them and build better, more cohesive solutions.
- 🎯 I’m currently looking for an internship to gain practical experience and deepen my knowledge in software development.
      I’m eager to contribute to exciting projects while continuing to learn and grow as a developer.
